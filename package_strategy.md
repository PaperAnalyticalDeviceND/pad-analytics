# Package Strategy for PyPI

## Package Identity

### Current Name: `pad-ml-workflow`
**Pros:**
- Descriptive of the technology (PAD) and purpose (ML workflow)
- Clear abbreviation

**Cons:**
- Generic sounding
- "PAD" might be confused with other meanings
- Doesn't convey the pharmaceutical/diagnostic aspect

### Alternative Names to Consider:

1. **`padml`** - Simple and short
2. **`paperdiag`** - Emphasizes paper diagnostics
3. **`colorpad`** - Highlights colorimetric analysis
4. **`padanalytics`** - Matches the main module name
5. **`papertest-ml`** - Clear about paper testing with ML
6. **`chromapad`** - Sophisticated, hints at color analysis
7. **`rapidpad`** - Emphasizes quick testing
8. **`padqc`** - PAD Quality Control

## Target Audience

### Primary Users:
1. **Researchers** in pharmaceutical quality and diagnostics
2. **Data Scientists** working on medical/pharmaceutical ML
3. **Field Workers** needing drug quality testing tools
4. **Educational Institutions** teaching analytical chemistry

### Use Cases to Emphasize:
- Pharmaceutical quality control in low-resource settings
- Research on paper-based diagnostics
- Development of new colorimetric assays
- Machine learning for medical diagnostics

## Package Positioning

### Key Differentiators:
1. **Specialized**: Not a general ML library, but focused on PAD analysis
2. **Complete Workflow**: From data access to prediction to visualization
3. **Dual Model Support**: Both statistical (PLS) and deep learning approaches
4. **Research-Grade**: Developed and used in academic research

### PyPI Description (Short):
"Machine learning tools for analyzing Paper Analytical Devices (PADs) to detect and quantify pharmaceutical compounds through colorimetric analysis."

### Keywords for Discovery:
- paper analytical device
- PAD
- colorimetric analysis
- pharmaceutical quality
- drug detection
- machine learning
- diagnostics
- quality control
- paper-based testing
- medical diagnostics

## Marketing Strategy

### README Focus:
1. **Lead with the problem**: Drug quality testing in resource-limited settings
2. **Show the solution**: ML-powered analysis of simple paper tests
3. **Demonstrate value**: Quick examples with real results
4. **Build trust**: Citation, research backing, university affiliation

### Documentation Priorities:
1. **Quick Start**: Get users to a working example in < 5 minutes
2. **Real Examples**: Show actual drug detection scenarios
3. **Model Explanation**: Help users understand what the models do
4. **API Clarity**: Clear reference for all functions

## Pre-Publication Checklist

### Essential Fixes:
1. [ ] Choose final package name
2. [ ] Update all imports to match package name
3. [ ] Remove empty modules (pls_model.py)
4. [ ] Add error handling for API failures
5. [ ] Include sample data for testing without API access

### Nice to Have:
1. [ ] Offline mode for cached data
2. [ ] Model performance benchmarks
3. [ ] Visualization gallery
4. [ ] Integration with common ML frameworks

## Competitive Analysis

### Similar Packages:
- **scikit-image**: General image processing (we're specialized)
- **colorimetry**: Color analysis (we add ML and PAD specifics)
- **medical-ml**: Medical ML tools (we're focused on one technique)

### Our Niche:
We're the only package specifically for PAD + ML workflows, making us the go-to solution for this research area.
